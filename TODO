Test Complex

--------------------------
Is it worth to cast away the derivatives that became 0?
Expensive and only known at runtime... Not worth, this is not type stable


---------------------------

The reason why 
 z = DiffCheck{ Complex{Float64}, (:z, ) }(1.0, NamedTuple{(:z, ), NTuple{1, Complex{Float64}}}((1.0, )))
 is not working is that 1.0 is not promoted automatically to Complex{Float64}
  The following works
 z = DiffCheck{ Complex{Float64}, (:z, ) }(1.0+0*im, NamedTuple{(:z, ), NTuple{1, Complex{Float64}}}((1.0+0*im, )))
 MethodError: no method matching DiffCheck{Complex{Float64},(:z,),N} where N(::Float64, ::NamedTuple{(:z,),Tuple{Complex{Float64}}})
